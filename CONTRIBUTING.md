## Where to put your code?

1. select folder according to your project level. (basic projects will be in basic, projects like game or bots will be in intermediate and if you're using apis or something that will be in advance)

2. make a folder and start its name with your github username and then project name (dont't put spaces use '-' instead)

3. create a README.md in your project folder and describe about your project and add a short video if possible (you can use bandicam for that!)

4. for reference [have a look](https://github.com/Tamanna-S/javaScript-projects/tree/main/basic-projects/clock)
