Do the To-Do List!
The template (tag) to include the above is {{to do}}. The dynamic list in the box is drawn from a subpage of the talk page represented simply by "to do."

For a list of all articles with to-do lists, see Category:Wikipedia pages with to-do lists. Check the category page from time to time if you're looking for articles to help out on. This is a great way to contribute to Wikipedia.

To-do lists focus on improving otherwise adequate articles: tasks in to-do lists are important, significant, but not urgent (example: "insert a history section", or "provide more examples in the introduction").

The "to do" collaboration mechanism has the following advantages:

the list of tasks is permanently visible in the talk page of the article, i.e. where most editors will see it.
articles with To-dos are automatically listed in the list of articles with To dos, so that additional editors unaware of the article are also attracted to it. More specialized sub-categories can be defined for specific purposes (e.g. for a WikiProject).
Feel free to discuss to-do lists in the talk page of articles, to add new tasks, or to work on pending tasks. We also encourage you to contribute to other articles by visiting the list of "articles with To-dos", at Category:Wikipedia pages with to-do lists.
